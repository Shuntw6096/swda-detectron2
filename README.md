# A Detectron2 Implementation of [Strong-Weak Distribution Alignment for Adaptive Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.04798.pdf) (CVPR 2019)
Official Implementation: [VisionLearningGroup/DA_Detection](https://github.com/VisionLearningGroup/DA_Detection)
### Features
now only supports [ResNet50-FPN](https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron2/blob/main/configs/Base-RCNN-FPN.yaml)
1. local alignment (image alignment)
2. global alignment (image alignment)
3. context vector base regularization
4. Few-shot tuning

### Environment
```
python 3.8.11
pytorch 1.9.0 (conda)
torchvision 0.10.0 (conda)
detectron2 0.5+cu111 (cuda is optional, detectron2 has cpu version) (pip)
tensorboard 2.6.0 (pip)
opencv-python (pip)
pycocotools (pip)
```
### Data preparation

1. make your dataset format to voc (recommended) or coco, or [other format](https://detectron2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/builtin_datasets.html) that detectron2 supports
2. register your dataset at [faster_rcnn/data/register.py](https://github.com/Shuntw6096/swda-detectron2/blob/main/faster_rcnn/data/register.py)

```python
# VOC format
dataset_dir = $YOUR_DATASET_ROOT
classes = ('person', 'two-wheels', 'four-wheels') # dataset classes
years = 2007
# to find image list at $YOUR_DATASET_ROOT/ImaegSets/Main/{$split}.txt, only "train", "test", "val", "trainval"
split = 'train'
# call your dataset by this
meta_name = 'itri-taiwan-416_{}'.format(split)
# call register_pascal_voc to register
register_pascal_voc(meta_name, dataset_dir, split, years, classes)


# coco format
json_file_path = $YOUR_COCO_JSON_PATH
image_root = $YOUR_IMAGE_DIR_PATH
split = 'test'
# call your dataset by this
meta_name = 'tokyo-320-test_{}'.format(split)
# 'thing_classes' contains dataset classes information, be aware of class order
meta_data = {'thing_classes':['person','two-wheels','four-wheels']}
# call register_coco_instances to register
register_coco_instances(meta_name, meta_data, json_file_path, image_root)
```
